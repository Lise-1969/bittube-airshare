# BitTube-AirShare

Share your file with your friend trough torrent with WebTorrent and WEBRTC.

Looks like [Instant.io](http://instant.io) but is more intuitive and very lite!

### Installation
Upload content of public folder to your favorite hosting plan.
That's all :)

### How do I share a file?
Simply drag and drop it into the page and the browser will seed your file. Share the link with your friends and the download begin.
It uses the WebTorrent protocol so everything is very fast!

### How do I stop sharing a file?
While your friends still have the site open, the file can still be downloaded even if the first seeder is gone.

### Is it compatible with other WebTorrent apps?
You can download from any app that uses the WebTorrent protocol. Like [Instant.io](http://instant.io) or [WebTorrent Desktop](https://webtorrent.io/desktop).

Enjoy !
